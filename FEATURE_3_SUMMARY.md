### Infrastructure Layer (`edge_device_fleet_manager/repository/infrastructure/`)

**Event Store:**
- `InMemoryEventStore`: In-memory event storage for testing
- `SqlEventStore`: SQL-based persistent event storage
- Event versioning and concurrency control

**Repositories:**
- `InMemoryDeviceRepository`: In-memory device storage
- `SqlDeviceRepository`: SQL-based device persistence
- SQLAlchemy models for database mapping

**Unit of Work:**

- Migration utilities
- Test database creation

### Application Layer (`edge_device_fleet_manager/repository/application/`)

**CQRS Implementation:**
- `Command`: Base command class with validation
- `Query`: Base query class with pagination support
- `CommandHandler`: Command processing and validation
- `QueryHandler`: Query processing and result formatting

**Commands:**
- `RegisterDeviceCommand`: Register new devices
- `UpdateDeviceCommand`: Update device information
- `DeactivateDeviceCommand`: Deactivate devices
- `ActivateDeviceCommand`: Activate devices
- `UpdateLocationCommand`: Update device location
- `UpdateCapabilitiesCommand`: Update device capabilities
- `UpdateConfigurationCommand`: Update device configuration
- `RecordMetricsCommand`: Record device metrics

**Queries:**
- `GetDeviceQuery`: Retrieve single device
- `ListDevicesQuery`: List devices with pagination
- `SearchDevicesQuery`: Search devices with filters

**DTOs:**
- `DeviceDto`: Device data transfer object
- `DeviceIdentifierDto`: Device identifier DTO
- `DtoConverter`: Conversion utilities

**Services:**
- `DeviceApplicationService`: High-level device operations
- Orchestrates commands and queries
- Provides simplified API for external consumers

- Optimized query performance
- Command validation and processing
- Query result formatting

### 3. Domain-Driven Design
- Rich domain model with business logic
- Aggregate boundaries and consistency
- Domain services for complex operations
- Value objects for data integrity

### 4. Clean Architecture

## üìä Performance Characteristics

- **Memory Usage**: Efficient in-memory storage for testing
- **Database**: SQLAlchemy ORM with connection pooling
- **Concurrency**: Optimistic locking with version control
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling through event sourcing
- **Reliability**: Transaction management with rollback support

## üîß Configuration

The repository system integrates with the existing configuration system:
- Database connection settings
- Event store configuration
- Caching parameters
- Logging configuration

## üéØ Usage Examples

```python
# Register a new device
result = await app_service.register_device(
    name="Temperature Sensor 001",
    device_type=DeviceType.SENSOR,
    serial_number="TS001",
    manufacturer="SensorCorp"
)

# Query device information
device = await app_service.get_device(device_id)

# Update device configuration
await app_service.update_device_configuration(
    device_id=device_id,
    key="sampling_rate",
    value=1000
)

# Record device metrics
await app_service.record_device_metrics(
    device_id=device_id,
    metrics=DeviceMetrics.create_now(
        cpu_usage_percent=75.0,
        memory_usage_percent=60.0,
        temperature_celsius=45.0
    )
)
```

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

1. **Distributed Event Store**: Redis or Apache Kafka integration
2. **Read Model Projections**: Materialized views for complex queries
3. **Event Streaming**: Real-time event processing
4. **Saga Pattern**: Long-running business processes
5. **GDPR Compliance**: Data retention and deletion policies
6. **Multi-tenancy**: Tenant isolation and data segregation

## ‚úÖ Completion Status

Feature 3 is **COMPLETE** and ready for integration with the broader Edge Device Fleet Manager system. All core functionality has been implemented, tested, and validated according to the domain-driven design principles and clean architecture patterns.

The implementation provides a solid foundation for device management that can scale from small deployments to enterprise-level IoT fleets while maintaining data consistency, auditability, and performance.
