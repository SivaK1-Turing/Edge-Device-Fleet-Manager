5. **Configuration Management** (`edge_device_fleet_manager/discovery/config.py`)
   - Hierarchical configuration system
   - Protocol-specific settings
   - Environment variable support
   - Security and network configuration

6. **Discovery Protocols** (`edge_device_fleet_manager/discovery/protocols/`)
   - **mDNS Discovery** (`mdns.py`) - Multicast DNS service discovery
   - **SSDP Discovery** (`ssdp.py`) - Simple Service Discovery Protocol
   - **SNMP Discovery** (`snmp.py`) - Network device discovery via SNMP
   - **Network Scan** (`network_scan.py`) - Port scanning and service detection

## 🚀 Key Features

### Plugin Architecture
- **Hot-Reloadable Plugins**: Dynamic loading and unloading without system restart

- **Subscription Management**: Dynamic subscription and unsubscription
- **Async Event Handling**: Non-blocking event processing

### Intelligent Scheduling
- **Priority-Based Execution**: High-priority jobs execute first
- **Concurrent Processing**: Configurable concurrent job limits
- **Adaptive Timing**: Dynamic interval adjustment based on network conditions
- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- **Resource Management**: Memory and CPU usage optimization

### Multi-Protocol Support
- **mDNS/Bonjour**: Apple and IoT device discovery

## 🔧 Usage Examples

### Basic Discovery
```python
from edge_device_fleet_manager.discovery.core import DiscoveryEngine
from edge_device_fleet_manager.discovery.config import DiscoveryConfig

# Create and configure discovery engine
config = DiscoveryConfig()
engine = DiscoveryEngine(config)

# Initialize and start discovery
await engine.initialize()
result = await engine.discover_all()

print(f"Found {len(result.devices)} devices")
```

### Plugin Development
```python
from edge_device_fleet_manager.discovery.plugins.base import DiscoveryPlugin
from edge_device_fleet_manager.discovery.plugins.decorators import discovery_plugin

@discovery_plugin(
    name="my_protocol",
    version="1.0.0",
    description="Custom discovery protocol",
    author="Developer Name"
)
class MyDiscoveryPlugin(DiscoveryPlugin):
    async def initialize(self):
        # Plugin initialization
        pass
    
    async def discover(self, **kwargs):
        # Discovery implementation
        result = DiscoveryResult(protocol="my_protocol", success=True)
        # Add discovered devices to result
        return result
    
    async def cleanup(self):
        # Cleanup resources
        pass
```

### Event Handling
```python
from edge_device_fleet_manager.discovery.events import DiscoveryEventBus, EventFilter

# Create event bus and subscribe to device discoveries
event_bus = DiscoveryEventBus()

async def on_device_discovered(event):
    print(f"New device found: {event.device.name} at {event.device.ip_address}")

# Subscribe with filtering
device_filter = EventFilter(event_types=["device.discovered"])
await event_bus.subscribe(on_device_discovered, device_filter)
